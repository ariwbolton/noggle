# Noggle

A realtime multiplayer Boggle game, using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), Postgres, and React.

(A weekend project which isn't finished, doesn't work, and unfortunately probably never will. I've shifted focus onto other projects ðŸ˜”.)

### Setup

- Add a file named `english-scrabble-dictionary.txt` to the `data` directory
  - Each line should contain a word, whitespace, and definition
  - Use [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XIFdZukAcDRiDIOgR_rHpICrrgJbLBxV/view) file
  - [Here](https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/38366/latest-collins-scrabble-words-list-in-text-file) is the Stack Exchange post which linked to the file used. (The 2019 file without definitions was linked above.)
